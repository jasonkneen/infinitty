## Your First Command

After installing Infinitty, open the app and you'll see the main interface:

1. **Terminal on the left** - Your native shell
2. **AI Panel on the right** - Chat with Claude
3. **Command bar at the bottom** - Execute commands or ask AI

Type your first command:

```bash
echo "Hello from Infinitty!"
```

Press Enter to execute. You'll see output appear in the terminal.

## Ask AI for Help

Click the AI panel or press `Cmd+I` and ask:

```
How do I list all files in the current directory?
```

Claude will:
- Explain the command
- Show you the shell command
- Let you execute it directly

Click the blue "Execute" button to run the suggested command.

## Terminal Mode vs Block Mode

### Ghostty Mode (Default)

Classic terminal with AI alongside. Press `Cmd+,` to toggle between:
- Full terminal
- Split view with AI panel

### OpenWarp Mode

Commands shown as editable "blocks":

```
[Cmd] ls -la
[Output] Showing 15 items...

[Cmd] cd projects
[Cmd] █  (new command)
```

Edit previous commands by clicking them. Ask AI without typing.

## Basic Navigation

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+,` | Open Settings |
| `Cmd+I` | Focus AI input |
| `Cmd+K` | Command palette |
| `Cmd+T` | New tab |
| `Cmd+W` | Close tab |
| `Cmd+1-9` | Switch tabs |

## Creating Your First Widget

Widgets let you visualize data or automate tasks.

### 1. Open Widget Creator

```
Press Cmd+K → "Create Widget"
```

### 2. Choose Template

- **Workflow** - Visual DAG editor
- **Chart** - Data visualization
- **Custom** - React component

### 3. Design Your Workflow

In the Workflow widget:

1. Click "+" to add nodes
2. Choose node type (input, process, output)
3. Connect nodes by dragging
4. Click "Run" to execute

### 4. Save Your Work

```
Cmd+S to save
Give it a name: "My First Workflow"
```

Later, run it with:

```
ai "Run workflow: My First Workflow"
```

## Working with Files

### File Explorer

- **Sidebar** shows your current directory tree
- **Double-click** to open in editor
- **Right-click** for context menu (rename, delete, etc.)

### Opening Files in Terminal

```bash
# From AI panel:
ai "Show me the contents of package.json"
# Claude will display the file

# From terminal:
cat package.json
```

## Using AI Effectively

### Good Prompts

```
"Generate a bash script to backup all .txt files"
ai "Show me the top 10 largest files in this directory"
"Create a workflow that processes CSV files"
```

### AI Responds With

- **Code snippets** (copy with one click)
- **Executable commands** (run directly)
- **Explanations** (understand what's happening)
- **Widgets** (visualizations and tools)

## Settings

Press `Cmd+,` to customize:

- **Theme** - Light/dark/auto
- **Font** - JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, etc.
- **Font Size** - 10-24px
